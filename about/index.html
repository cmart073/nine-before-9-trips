                    <h1>About Nine Before 9 Trips</h1>
                    <p class="lead">Detailed, honest golf trip planning guides for serious golfers. No fluff, no affiliate spam—just the information you need to plan trips worth taking.</p>

                    <h2>Why This Site Exists</h2>
                    <p>Most golf travel content falls into two categories: surface-level listicles that don't help with actual planning, or thinly disguised affiliate marketing that recommends whatever pays the highest commission.</p>
                    <p>I built Nine Before 9 Trips because I wanted the kind of detailed, transparent planning information I wish had existed when researching my own golf trips. Real cost breakdowns, honest tradeoffs, seasonal considerations, and practical itineraries based on extensive research.</p>
                    <p>Every guide takes weeks to compile. I gather pricing data from multiple sources, read trip reports from golfers who've been there, study weather patterns, and map out realistic schedules. The goal is to give you enough information to decide if a destination is right for your group, and if so, how to plan it properly.</p>

                    <h2>Editorial Independence</h2>
                    <p>Nine Before 9 Trips does not accept payment from golf resorts, tour operators, hotels, or booking platforms. If I recommend something, it's because I believe it's the right choice for golfers—not because someone paid me to say it.</p>
                    <p>Some links on this site are affiliate links, meaning I may earn a small commission if you book through them. This helps cover the cost of running the site. However, affiliate relationships do not influence the content of the guides. I only link to services I would use myself, and I'm transparent about when links are affiliate relationships. You can read more on the <a href="/affiliate-disclosure/">Affiliate Disclosure</a> page.</p>

                    <h2>Who This Site Is For</h2>
                    <p>Nine Before 9 Trips is designed for serious golfers planning destination trips. If you care about course quality, golf history, and want detailed information to plan effectively, these guides will be useful.</p>
                    <p>This site is not for casual golfers looking for resort vacations with multiple activities, or groups where golf is secondary to other amenities. The focus is purely on golf-first destinations.</p>
