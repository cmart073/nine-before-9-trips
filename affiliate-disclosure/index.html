                    <h2>How This Site Makes Money</h2>
                    <p>Nine Before 9 Trips uses affiliate links to generate revenue. When you click certain links on this site and make a purchase or booking, I may earn a small commission at no additional cost to you.</p>
                    <p>These commissions help cover the cost of maintaining the site, conducting research, and creating new trip guides. Without this revenue, the site wouldn't be sustainable.</p>

                    <h2>What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
                    <p>Affiliate links are special URLs that track when someone clicks from this site to a partner website and completes a purchase or booking. Common affiliate partners include:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                        <li>Booking platforms (hotels, lodging)</li>
                        <li>Flight search engines</li>
                        <li>Car rental services</li>
                        <li>Golf tour operators</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you see a link on this site directing you to one of these services, it may be an affiliate link.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>Editorial Independence</h2>
                    <p>Affiliate relationships do not influence the content of trip guides. I do not recommend destinations, courses, lodging, or services based on commission rates. If something is recommended on this site, it's because I believe it's the right choice for golfers planning that particular trip.</p>
                    <p>Nine Before 9 Trips does not accept payment from golf resorts, hotels, or tour operators in exchange for coverage or favorable reviews. All recommendations are based on independent research.</p>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
                    <p>You are never required to use affiliate links. If you prefer to book directly or search for better rates elsewhere, that's completely fine. The goal of these guides is to provide useful information regardless of how you choose to book.</p>
