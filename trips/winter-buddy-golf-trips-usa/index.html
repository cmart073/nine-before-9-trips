                    <p class="lead">If you're looking to escape winter for a quick golf trip with your buddies, these destinations deliver reliable weather, great courses, and minimal planning hassle—all in a long weekend.</p>

                    <h2>Why Winter Buddy Golf Trips Work</h2>
                    <p>Winter golf trips have become one of the easiest ways for groups to plan an annual tradition. If you live somewhere cold, a few days in the desert or Southern California feels like a reset. The logistics are simpler than summer trips because everyone's less busy, and the courses aren't as crowded.</p>
                    <p>Most importantly, these trips fit into long weekends. You don't need to burn a full week of vacation time or coordinate complex schedules. Fly in Friday morning, play three rounds, fly out Sunday night or Monday. Done.</p>
                    <p>The other advantage is that winter golf destinations tend to be well-established with good infrastructure. You're not pioneering a trip—you're following a well-worn path that thousands of groups take every year. That means easier booking, predictable costs, and fewer surprises.</p>

                    <h2>What Makes a Good 3–4 Day Buddy Trip</h2>
                    <p>Not every golf destination works for a short trip. I've focused on places that meet specific criteria:</p>
                    <p><strong>Direct flights from major hubs.</strong> If your group has to connect twice to get there, the trip becomes a logistical headache. The best winter destinations have direct service from most major cities.</p>
                    <p><strong>High density of quality courses.</strong> You need enough courses within a 20-minute drive that you're not spending half your trip in a car. The destinations on this list all have at least a dozen solid courses clustered together.</p>
                    <p><strong>Reliable winter weather.</strong> You're not looking for guarantees, but you want a high probability of playable conditions. These destinations all have January and February averages well above 60 degrees with minimal rain.</p>
                    <p><strong>Easy group lodging.</strong> Whether it's a rental house, a golf resort, or off-strip hotels, you need options that work for groups of four to eight without complicated coordination.</p>

                    <h2>The Best US Winter Buddy Golf Trip Destinations</h2>
                    
                    <p><strong><a href="/trips/scottsdale-winter-golf-trip/">Scottsdale / Phoenix</a></strong><br>
                    The most popular winter golf destination in the US for good reason. Excellent courses, easy logistics, and the right balance of golf-first focus with enough off-course options to keep everyone happy. Best for groups that want premium desert golf without Vegas distractions.</p>

                    <p><strong><a href="/trips/las-vegas-winter-golf-trip/">Las Vegas</a></strong><br>
                    Golf by day, Vegas by night. The courses around Las Vegas are better than most people realize, and the entertainment options are unmatched. Best for groups that want nightlife and activities beyond golf.</p>

                    <p><strong><a href="/trips/palm-springs-winter-golf-trip/">Palm Springs</a></strong><br>
                    Relaxed, reliable, and packed with courses. Palm Springs is the most laid-back option on this list with the highest concentration of golf per square mile. Best for groups that prioritize golf volume and don't need much else.</p>

                    <p><strong><a href="/trips/san-diego-winter-golf-trip/">San Diego (North County)</a></strong><br>
                    Coastal scenery, premium courses, and the best winter weather in the country. San Diego costs more but delivers a different vibe than the desert destinations. Best for groups willing to pay extra for ocean views and top-tier courses like Torrey Pines.</p>

                    <h2>Typical Cost for a Winter Buddy Golf Trip</h2>
                    <p>I've broken down what most groups actually spend on a 3-night, 4-round trip to these destinations:</p>
                    
                    <div class="table-wrapper">
                        <table class="cost-table">
                            <thead>
                                <tr>
                                    <th>Expense</th>
                                    <th>Estimated Cost (Per Person)</th>
                                </tr>
                            </thead>
                            <tbody>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>Flights (Round-Trip)</td>
                                    <td>$250 – $500</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>Lodging (3 nights)</td>
                                    <td>$300 – $600</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>Green Fees (4 rounds)</td>
                                    <td>$400 – $800</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>Rental Car (split)</td>
                                    <td>$75 – $150</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>Food & Drinks</td>
                                    <td>$200 – $400</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr class="total-row">
                                    <td><strong>Typical Total</strong></td>
                                    <td><strong>$1,225 – $2,450</strong></td>
                                </tr>
                            </tbody>
                        </table>
                    </div>

                    <p>These ranges reflect the difference between budget-conscious trips and groups that prioritize premium courses and accommodations. Scottsdale and San Diego tend toward the higher end. Las Vegas and Palm Springs can be done more affordably if you pick the right courses and stay off-strip.</p>
                    <p>The biggest variable is green fees. If you stick to municipal courses and avoid resort pricing, you can keep rounds under $100 each. If you're playing TPC Scottsdale or Torrey Pines, expect $250+ per round in peak season.</p>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>How to Pick the Right Destination for Your Group</h2>
                    <p>If your group cares primarily about golf and wants the easiest logistics, Scottsdale is the default choice. It has the best combination of course quality, accessibility, and infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>If your group wants nightlife and entertainment beyond golf, Las Vegas is the obvious pick. The strip offers everything, and the golf is better than it gets credit for.</p>
                    <p>If your group just wants to play as much golf as possible in a relaxed setting, Palm Springs wins. The course density is unmatched, and the vibe is low-key.</p>
                    <p>If your group is willing to spend more for premium courses and coastal scenery, San Diego delivers. Torrey Pines alone makes it worth considering.</p>
                    <p>Budget matters too. Las Vegas and Palm Springs can be done affordably. Scottsdale and San Diego skew more expensive, especially if you're booking in February or March when demand peaks.</p>
