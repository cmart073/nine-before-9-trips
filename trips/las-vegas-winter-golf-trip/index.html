                    <h1>Las Vegas Winter Golf Trip: Golf by Day, Vegas by Night</h1>
                    <p class="lead">Vegas delivers better golf than most people realize, combined with entertainment options no other destination can match. If your group wants golf plus nightlife, this is the obvious choice.</p>
                </div>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>Why Vegas Is an Underrated Winter Golf Trip</h2>
                    <p>Most people don't think of Las Vegas as a golf destination, but it should be on the list. The city has over 30 courses, many of them excellent, and the winter weather is nearly perfect for golf. Daytime highs in the 60s, almost no rain, and comfortable conditions for walking 18 holes.</p>
                    <p>The real advantage is what happens after golf. No other destination on this list offers the variety of restaurants, bars, shows, and entertainment that Vegas does. If your group wants more than just golf, Vegas delivers.</p>
                    <p>The logistics are also simpler than you'd expect. Harry Reid International Airport is well-connected with direct flights from most major cities. Courses are spread out but accessible, and lodging options range from budget-friendly off-strip hotels to high-end resorts on the strip.</p>
                    <p>Vegas also tends to be more affordable than Scottsdale or San Diego if you're strategic about where you stay and which courses you play. You can find solid golf for under $100 per round, and off-strip hotels are often cheaper than Scottsdale resorts.</p>

                    <h2>Cost Expectations for a Vegas Buddy Trip</h2>
                    <p>Here's what a 3-night, 4-round trip typically costs:</p>

                    <p>Green fees vary widely. If you play Wynn Golf Club or Shadow Creek, expect $500 per round. If you stick to solid public courses like Paiute or Boulder Creek, you'll pay $75 to $150.</p>
                    <p>Lodging is cheaper if you stay off-strip. You can find good hotels in Henderson or Summerlin for $80 to $150 per night. On-strip hotels run $150 to $300+ depending on the property and timing.</p>
                    <p>Food and drinks can add up quickly in Vegas, especially if you're eating on the strip or going to clubs. Budget accordingly.</p>

                    <h2>Where to Stay (Strip vs Off-Strip)</h2>
                    <p>You have two main strategies:</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Stay on the Strip</strong><br>
                    If your group wants easy access to nightlife, restaurants, and entertainment, staying on the strip makes sense. You'll pay more, but everything is walkable. The downside is you'll be driving 20 to 40 minutes to most golf courses.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stay Off-Strip</strong><br>
                    Henderson or Summerlin puts you closer to the best golf courses and costs less. You'll need to drive to the strip for nightlife, but Ubers are cheap and plentiful. This works well for groups that prioritize golf and don't mind a bit of driving.</p>

                    <h2>Best Golf Courses Near Las Vegas</h2>
                    <p><strong>Paiute Golf Resort (Wolf, Sun Mountain, Snow Mountain)</strong><br>
                    Three Pete Dye courses about 30 minutes north of the strip. Excellent conditions, challenging layouts, and reasonable pricing. Wolf is the most famous, but all three are worth playing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Boulder Creek Golf Club</strong><br>
                    A solid daily-fee course in Boulder City with dramatic elevation changes and great views. Well-maintained and affordable.</p>

                    <p><strong>TPC Las Vegas</strong><br>
                    Home of the Shriners Open. Well-conditioned, playable, and closer to the strip than most other quality courses. Pricing is higher but reasonable for a TPC.</p>

                    <p><strong>Reflection Bay at Lake Las Vegas</strong><br>
                    A Jack Nicklaus design with stunning views of Lake Las Vegas. It's a bit of a drive but worth it for the scenery and conditions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wynn Golf Club</strong><br>
                    If your group wants to splurge, Wynn is as good as it gets in Vegas. It's an exclusive, ultra-private course on the strip with impeccable conditions. Expensive but unforgettable.</p>

                    <h2>Sample 3–4 Day Itinerary</h2>
                    <p><strong>Day 1 (Friday):</strong> Fly in, pick up rental car, play an afternoon round at Boulder Creek. Check into hotel, dinner and drinks on the strip.</p>

                    <p><strong>Day 2 (Saturday):</strong> Morning round at Paiute Wolf. Afternoon at the pool or explore. Evening show or nightlife on the strip.</p>

                    <p><strong>Day 3 (Sunday):</strong> Morning round at TPC Las Vegas. Afternoon at Reflection Bay or rest. Dinner and final night out.</p>

                    <p><strong>Day 4 (Monday):</strong> Optional early morning round at Paiute Sun Mountain or head to the airport.</p>

                    <p>This itinerary balances golf with Vegas activities. If your group just wants to max out golf, you can easily play five or six rounds.</p>

                    <h2>Flights & Transportation</h2>
                    <p>Las Vegas is one of the most accessible cities in the US. Harry Reid International Airport has direct flights from almost every major city. Flights are often cheap, especially if you book in advance or travel midweek.</p>

                    <p>Rent a car. You'll need it to get to courses, especially if you're staying on the strip. Most courses are 20 to 45 minutes away, and Ubers add up quickly if you're making multiple trips per day.</p>

                    <h2>Who Vegas Is (and Isn't) Right For</h2>
                    <p>Vegas is perfect for groups that want golf plus nightlife. If half your group cares about golf and half cares about entertainment, Vegas accommodates both. It's also good for groups that like variety and don't want to spend every waking moment on a golf course.</p>
                    <p>That said, if your group is purely golf-focused and doesn't care about the strip, <a href="/trips/scottsdale-winter-golf-trip/">Scottsdale</a> will give you better course access and a more relaxed vibe.</p>
                    <p>Vegas also isn't ideal if your group wants a low-key, chill trip. The city is loud, busy, and designed for activity. If you're looking for peace and quiet, this isn't it.</p>
