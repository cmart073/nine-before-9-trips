                    <h1>Palm Springs Winter Golf Trip: Relaxed, Reliable, and Golf-First</h1>
                    <p class="lead">Palm Springs offers the highest concentration of golf courses in the US, reliable winter weather, and a laid-back vibe. If your group just wants to play as much golf as possible, this is the spot.</p>
                </div>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>Why Palm Springs Is Ideal in Winter</h2>
                    <p>Palm Springs and the surrounding Coachella Valley have over 100 golf courses packed into a relatively small area. You can play a different course every day for months and never repeat. That density means minimal driving between rounds and maximum golf time.</p>
                    <p>The winter weather is about as reliable as you'll find anywhere. January through March sees daytime highs in the mid-70s with almost no rain. It's warm enough to play comfortably but not the oppressive heat that hits in summer.</p>
                    <p>The vibe is more relaxed than Scottsdale or Vegas. Palm Springs doesn't have the nightlife scene or the crowds. It's a destination built around golf, tennis, and poolside relaxation. If your group wants to focus on golf without distractions, Palm Springs delivers.</p>
                    <p>The other advantage is flexibility. With so many courses, you can usually get tee times even if you're booking last minute. You're not locked into a specific itinerary months in advance.</p>

                    <h2>What a Palm Springs Trip Actually Costs</h2>
                    <p>Here's a realistic breakdown for a 3-night, 4-round trip:</p>
                    
                    <div class="table-wrapper">
                        <table class="cost-table">

                                </tr>
                                <tr>

                                    <td>$300 – $600</td>

                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>Rental Car (split)</td>
                                    <td>$75 – $125</td>

                        </table>
                    </div>

                    <p>Green fees vary significantly. Premium courses like PGA West Stadium or Indian Wells Celebrity run $200 to $300 in peak season. But you can find excellent daily-fee courses for $75 to $125. The course density means you can mix and match based on budget.</p>
                    <p>Lodging options range from budget motels to high-end resorts. A rental house or condo split among a group often delivers the best value. You get more space, a kitchen, and a pool for less than staying at a resort.</p>
                    <p>Flights to Palm Springs Airport are convenient but sometimes more expensive than flying into Ontario or LAX and driving. If you're coming from the West Coast, driving can also make sense.</p>

                    <h2>Where to Stay in the Coachella Valley</h2>
                    <p>The Coachella Valley includes Palm Springs, Palm Desert, La Quinta, Indian Wells, and Rancho Mirage. Each area has its own character.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Palm Springs</strong><br>
                    The most iconic and central location. Good restaurants, walkable downtown, and access to courses. Stays here tend to be mid-range in price.</p>

                    <p><strong>Palm Desert / La Quinta</strong><br>
                    More residential and spread out. This is where you'll find PGA West and many other top courses. Good for rental houses and quieter accommodations.</p>

                    <p><strong>Indian Wells</strong><br>
                    Upscale and resort-focused. Home to Indian Wells Golf Resort and Renaissance. Higher prices but excellent facilities.</p>

                    <h2>Best Courses for Buddy Trips</h2>
                    <p><strong>PGA West (Stadium, Nicklaus Tournament, Dye)</strong><br>
                    Three championship courses in La Quinta. The Stadium Course is the most famous with its island green 17th hole. All three are excellent and challenging. Expect premium pricing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Indian Wells Golf Resort (Celebrity and Players)</strong><br>
                    Two John Fought designs that are playable, scenic, and well-maintained. Celebrity hosts an LPGA event. Both courses are worth playing.</p>

                    <p><strong>SilverRock Resort</strong><br>
                    Arnold Palmer design in La Quinta. Former PGA Tour stop with excellent conditions and dramatic desert scenery. Pricing is reasonable for the quality.</p>

                    <p><strong>Desert Willow (Firecliff and Mountain View)</strong><br>
                    Two Michael Hurdzan designs in Palm Desert. Excellent daily-fee options with great conditions and reasonable rates. Both courses are solid choices.</p>

                    <p><strong>La Quinta Resort (Mountain and Dunes)</strong><br>
                    Classic resort courses that are more playable than some of the championship tracks. Good for groups with mixed skill levels.</p>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>Sample Long Weekend Itinerary</h2>
                    <p><strong>Day 1 (Friday):</strong> Fly in or drive, pick up rental car, play an afternoon round at Desert Willow Firecliff. Check into lodging, casual dinner.</p>

                    <p><strong>Day 2 (Saturday):</strong> Morning round at PGA West Stadium Course. Afternoon round at SilverRock or rest. Evening at the pool and dinner.</p>

                    <p><strong>Day 3 (Sunday):</strong> Morning round at Indian Wells Celebrity. Afternoon round at La Quinta Dunes or pool time. Dinner and drinks.</p>

                    <p><strong>Day 4 (Monday):</strong> Morning round at Desert Willow Mountain View or head home.</p>

                    <p>This gives you four quality rounds without feeling rushed. If your group wants more golf, you can easily squeeze in twilight rounds or play 36 holes on one of the days.</p>

                    <h2>Flights & Transportation</h2>
                    <p>Palm Springs International Airport is small but well-connected with direct flights from most major West Coast cities and hubs like Dallas, Chicago, and Denver. It's convenient but flights can be pricey.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>Alternative options include flying into Ontario Airport (about 90 minutes away) or LAX (about 2 hours). If you're coming from Southern California, driving is often easier than flying.</p>

                    <p>Rent a car. Courses are spread throughout the valley, and you'll need transportation. Most courses are 10 to 30 minutes apart.</p>

                    <h2>Who This Trip Fits Best</h2>
                    <p>Palm Springs is ideal for groups that prioritize golf volume over everything else. If you want to play four, five, or six rounds in three days without complications, this is the place. The course density and availability make it easy.</p>
                    <p>It's also good for groups on a budget. You can find quality golf without paying premium prices if you avoid the resort courses. The laid-back vibe means you're not pressured to spend money on activities or nightlife.</p>
                    <p>That said, if your group wants entertainment beyond golf, <a href="/trips/las-vegas-winter-golf-trip/">Las Vegas</a> or even Scottsdale offer more options. Palm Springs is quiet, especially at night.</p>
