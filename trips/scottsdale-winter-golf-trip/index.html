                    <h1>Scottsdale Winter Golf Trip: A Perfect 3–4 Day Buddy Escape</h1>
                    <p class="lead">Scottsdale is the most popular winter golf destination in the US for good reason. Excellent desert courses, easy logistics, and the right balance of golf focus with enough off-course options to keep any group happy.</p>
                </div>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>Why Scottsdale Works in Winter</h2>
                    <p>Scottsdale has more quality golf courses per square mile than almost anywhere in the country. When you land at Sky Harbor, you're 20 minutes from dozens of courses. That density makes planning simple—you're not driving an hour between rounds.</p>
                    <p>The weather in January, February, and March is nearly perfect for golf. Daytime highs in the low 70s, almost no rain, and comfortable evenings. It's warm enough to play in shorts but cool enough that walking 18 holes doesn't wreck you.</p>
                    <p>The infrastructure is built for groups. Every hotel, rental car company, and course knows how to handle buddy trips. Tee times are easy to book, lodging options are plentiful, and the restaurants and bars are set up for groups that want to unwind after a round.</p>
                    <p>The other advantage is that Scottsdale delivers premium golf without the complications of a destination like Bandon or Scotland. You're not dealing with weather volatility or remote locations. It's a straightforward trip that works for first-timers and annual traditions alike.</p>

                    <h2>What a Scottsdale Winter Golf Trip Costs</h2>
                    <p>Here's what you'll actually spend on a 3-night, 4-round trip:</p>
                    
                    <div class="table-wrapper">
                        <table class="cost-table">
                            <thead>
                                <tr>
                                    <th>Expense</th>
                                    <th>Estimated Cost (Per Person)</th>
                                </tr>
                            </thead>
                            <tbody>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>Flights (Round-Trip)</td>
                                    <td>$300 – $500</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>Lodging (3 nights)</td>
                                    <td>$350 – $700</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>Green Fees (4 rounds)</td>
                                    <td>$500 – $1,000</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>Rental Car (split)</td>
                                    <td>$100 – $150</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>Food & Drinks</td>
                                    <td>$250 – $400</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr class="total-row">
                                    <td><strong>Typical Total</strong></td>
                                    <td><strong>$1,500 – $2,750</strong></td>
                                </tr>
                            </tbody>
                        </table>
                    </div>

                    <p>Green fees are the biggest variable. If you play TPC Scottsdale, Troon North, or We-Ko-Pa, expect $200 to $300 per round in peak season. If you stick to solid daily-fee courses like Talking Stick or Raven at Verrado, you'll pay $100 to $150.</p>
                    <p>Lodging costs depend on whether you stay at a golf resort or book a rental house. Resorts like the Fairmont or Westin Kierland run $250+ per night. A rental house split among six or eight golfers brings the per-person cost way down.</p>
                    <p>Flights are reasonable from most major cities, especially if you book a month or two in advance. Phoenix is a major hub, so you'll find direct flights from almost anywhere.</p>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>Where to Stay</h2>
                    <p>You have two main options: golf resorts or rental houses.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Golf Resorts</strong><br>
                    Staying at a resort like the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, Westin Kierland, or JW Marriott Camelback puts you on or near a golf course with easy access to others. These properties are built for golf groups, with convenient shuttle service, good restaurants, and a social atmosphere. The tradeoff is cost—expect $250 to $400 per night during peak season.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rental Houses</strong><br>
                    If you have six or more golfers, renting a house in North Scottsdale makes sense. You get more space, a pool, and the ability to cook meals or have a late-night drink without hotel restrictions. The per-person cost is often lower than resorts, and the group bonding is better. The downside is you're responsible for coordinating everything yourself.</p>

                    <h2>Best Courses for a Short Trip</h2>
                    <p>Scottsdale has dozens of excellent courses. Here's how to prioritize for a long weekend:</p>

                    <p><strong>TPC Scottsdale (Stadium Course)</strong><br>
                    The must-play if you're willing to spend. Home of the Waste Management Phoenix Open and one of the most famous courses in the country. The 16th hole is iconic, and the condition is impeccable. Expect to pay $250 to $350 depending on timing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Troon North (Monument and Pinnacle)</strong><br>
                    Two of the best desert courses you'll find. Dramatic elevation changes, pristine conditions, and a true desert experience. Both courses are excellent, though Monument gets slightly more attention. Pricing is similar to TPC.</p>

                    <p><strong>We-Ko-Pa (Cholla and Saguaro)</strong><br>
                    Located on the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, We-Ko-Pa offers two outstanding Tom Doak and Bill Coore designs. Cholla is the more famous of the two, but both are worth playing. Rates are slightly lower than TPC or Troon.</p>

                    <p><strong>Talking Stick (North and South)</strong><br>
                    Solid daily-fee options that deliver great conditions and challenging layouts without premium pricing. Both courses are well-maintained and playable, making them ideal for groups that want quality without breaking the bank.</p>

                    <p><strong>Raven at Verrado</strong><br>
                    A bit west of Scottsdale but worth the drive. Excellent design, great conditions, and reasonable pricing. It's a hidden gem that locals play regularly.</p>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>Sample 3-Night Itinerary</h2>
                    <p><strong>Day 1 (Friday):</strong> Fly in early, pick up rental car, play an afternoon round at Talking Stick North. Check into lodging, dinner in Old Town Scottsdale.</p>

                    <p><strong>Day 2 (Saturday):</strong> Morning round at TPC Scottsdale Stadium Course. Afternoon round at We-Ko-Pa Cholla or Troon North Monument. Evening at resort or rental house.</p>

                    <p><strong>Day 3 (Sunday):</strong> Morning round at Raven at Verrado or We-Ko-Pa Saguaro. Afternoon pool time or explore Scottsdale. Dinner and drinks.</p>

                    <p><strong>Day 4 (Monday):</strong> Early morning round at Talking Stick South or skip golf and head to the airport.</p>

                    <p>This itinerary gives you four solid rounds without feeling rushed. If your group wants to play more, you can easily add a twilight round or squeeze in five rounds over three days.</p>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>Getting There</h2>
                    <p>Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport is the main gateway. It's a large hub with direct flights from most major US cities. From the airport, Scottsdale is about 20 to 30 minutes depending on traffic and where you're staying.</p>

                    <div class="cta-block">
                        <a href="/go/scottsdale-flights" class="cta-link">Compare flight options to Phoenix →</a>
                    </div>

                    <p>Rent a car at the airport. You'll need it to get between courses and your lodging. A mid-size SUV works well for a foursome with clubs. If you have more than four golfers, rent two cars or get a larger vehicle.</p>

                </section>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>Who This Trip Is Best For</h2>
                    <p>Scottsdale works for almost any group of golfers. If you want premium desert golf with minimal logistical complexity, this is the default choice. It's especially good for groups planning their first winter golf trip or looking to establish an annual tradition.</p>
                    <p>The courses are excellent but not overly difficult, so players of all skill levels can enjoy themselves. The weather is predictable, the infrastructure is solid, and there's enough to do off the course that you're not bored if someone wants a break from golf.</p>
                    <p>That said, if your group is looking for a party atmosphere like Vegas or a more budget-friendly option, <a href="/trips/palm-springs-winter-golf-trip/">Palm Springs</a> might be a better fit.</p>
